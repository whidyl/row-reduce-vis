# Linear Algebra Tinkerer / Row Reduction Visualizer / 
Become more comfortable with matrices by playing with different visualizations using this ReactJS web app. 
Utilizes LaTeX for mathematical visualizations. Uses the ThreeJS graphics library for 3D plane and vector visualizations.

Allows for the input of row operations. This allows you to see how the plane visualization of the system equations has the same solution space when any valid row-operation is applied. The plane is simply rotated about the its axis, leaving the solution space untouched.
